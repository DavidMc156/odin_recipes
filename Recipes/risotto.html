    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Risotto is an Italian dish made by cooking a starchy, short grain rice like arborio with stock until it becomes creamy. When you serve it on a plate, risotto should spread out into a silky, spoonable pool.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>350g Pack ready chopped butternut squash, opr half medium squash, peeled and chopped</li>
        <li>2 low-sodium chicken stock cubes</li>
        <li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
        <li>6 good quality sausages, meat squeezed from the skins and rolled into mini meatballs</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li> 6-8 thyme sprigs, leaves picked and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric</li>
        <li>200g risotto rice</li>
        <li>25g parmesan, grated, plus a little more to serve</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Method</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Boil the kettle. Put the squash in a heatproof bowl, add a splash of water and cover with cling film. Microwave on High for 8-10 mins or until the squash is tender. Meanwhile, crumble the stock cubes into a pan, add 1.2 litres hot water from the kettle and set over a low heat to simmer gently.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large, high-sided frying pan. Add the sausage meatballs and roll them around in the pan for 5-10 mins until browned all over and cooked through. Remove from the pan and set aside. Add the onion and sizzle gently for 5 mins, then add the garlic and cook for 1 min more, stirring to prevent it from burning. Stir in the thyme, turmeric and risotto rice for 1 min, coating the rice in the oil from the pan. Start adding the stock, a ladleful at a time, stirring well every 1-2 mins until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is cooked.</li>
        <li>Mash half the squash and add to the pan along with the sausage meatballs and Parmesan. Stir, then top with the remaining squash, cover with a lid and leave for 2 mins. Serve with extra Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
