# odin_recipes
odin project recipe page. Here we are going to build another simple web page
I should probably skip past it as i've already done a lot of Html and css using freecodecamp but at the same time I don't want to miss anything - things like git, which wasn't even touched on in fcc. Which is something I've found to be incredibly useful and will continue to practice and learn whilst going through the curriculum for the odin project
